                    <p>If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
                       When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph.
                       We created the Random Paragraph Generator with you in mind.<br/><br/>
                       The process is quite simple.
                       Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button.
                       Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.<br/><br/>
                       While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random paragraphs can be useful.
                       A few examples of how some people use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.</p>
